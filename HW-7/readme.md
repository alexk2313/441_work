## Objective
The objective for HW-7 was to make 5 different objects using the a Class. We were supposed to create a button that made a random object appear onclick.
## Problems
The only problem i really came across in this homework was trying to include an image within my object. I couldnt find any examples online and i searched thoroughly through the
class website. I tried using the "<img src = "image">" connotation but it was unable to recognize that within my object. I then tried setting the image externally to no avail. Other than
that i didnt really have any issues with this assignment.
