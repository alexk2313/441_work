## Objective
The objective for HW-9 was to get the hang of AJAX and using it to interact with jQuery and JSON. We also looked at a couple jQuery plugins.
## Problems
This week was pretty tough in a couple of ways. After linking my JSON page to the jsonajax.js page i tried to create a way for the JSON array to be accessed with the variable i by using a for loop.
This allowed for one part of my JSON array to appear but it would not go on to the next part of the Array. I could not completely figure out why this was. I did tons of research online and the only
real souces i could find about AJAX and JSON together were using HTML tables within the site. I did not want to post the JSON information to a table but rather diplay it as text within my container which i
didnt complete.
