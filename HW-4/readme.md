## Objective
The objective for this assignment was to create a series of choices and update the text depending on the choice the viewer made. This was done using javascipt functions within html
to change the text while using html to style the page.

## Choices
I chose to make a photoshop image of on ominous looking crow and to include that within my site. During my story one wrong choice could lead to death so you have to make your
choices wisely. This creates for an interesting and interactive story that is told through text and dialoge.

## Problems
The only problem i had was figuring out where to include my functions within the index file. Through trial and error i discovered that the functions work after the head and before the body.
I thought it was weird that they dont keep the color coding if placed there but it all worked out in the end.
