## Objective
The objective for week 12 was to create multiple objects and make things occur when those objects collide.
## Experience
I had to do alot of extra research to complete this project. A couple youtube videos really helped me understand how collision with objects created from a class could work. I also learned
how to make an object follow the mouse cordinates which i thought was pretty cool. This is the first time in awhile i have been fully satisfied with my finished product. I love it.
## Problems
i wanted to make circles collide instead of squares so i had to do a TON of extra research dealing with drawing circles and basing the collision off of the radius and what not. Overall
was a fun project.
