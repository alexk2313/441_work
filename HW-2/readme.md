## Objective
The objective for this assignment was to understand console log and how to execute javascript statements within html.
It was a very simple week and did not take long at all to complete
## Other comments
I did not run into any problems this week as it was rather easy. I feel myself becoming more comfortable with HTML and coding in general
Unfortunately i was not able to turn this assignment in on time because i was out of the country and did not account for having no internet.
