## Objective
The objective for HW-8 was to fadeIn and fadeOut images and words while having moving shapes, acheiving those objectives through the JQuery.
## Problems
It seems i always have trouble with images! this time i could get my first image to show up and fade. I attempted to put three images in a cycle of fading out and fading in but could
never get any images to show up after the first faded out. I did the same thing for my quotes and it worked perfectly. I put my three images in an array and tested the array in the console
to see if it actually had the images in. Long story short it had the values but wouldnt rotate within my site.
