## Objective
The objective for this assignment was to get used to using arrays. We were supposed to use arrays to create 10 "blank" images on a page and another
array to create random images to replace the "blanks" on click.
## Problems
Holy did i have some problems with this one. Understanding how to use arrays wasnt the problem because i already knew the basics from my
into to coding class where we covered p5. I go the blank images to show up as cards and the page loaded fine. As i added the random array and on click flip
my page began to bug out. I followed the steps in the homework example and reviewed it multiple times. Yet everytime i tried to view my page it would
never actually load. The loading icon would just keep spinning and spinning, needless to say i cant view the console if the page doesnt even load.

## Troubleshooting
If i commented out the random array function and flip function that page would load and my blanks would show up. I might just end up doing that to turn it in so
there is something to view. Due to this i knew the problem lies within my create random image or flip image functions. Like i said earlier i reviewed the homework example
and my own code multiple times but couldnt find any syntax errors or other errors. Maybe im just blind, but im not really sure what went wrong.
