## objective
This weeks objective was to learn the basics of javascript and accessing the DOM. Then to create the beginings of a choose your own adventure story.
I chose to make my story about a wizard that follows a crow into the unknown. The content relating to javascript was basically a review for coding i
have done in the past and it was all still fresh in my mind.
