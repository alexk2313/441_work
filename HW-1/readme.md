## Objective
The objective for this assignment was to create a simple self introduction site with a hero image.
This assignment was a good refresher for all the things we learned in our web design class. I used
containers and manipulated text, which are a couple topics my memory was a bit fuzzy on.
## Problems
I had to watch a couple youtube videos on how to make the hero image because i was struggling to get
my image to show up on the site at all. After i watched the videos it became more clear and i was able to
figure all of that out. The second problem i had was that my paragraphs were showing up was under my headers,
like all the way down in the next container. To fix this i added a Y translation for the "p" element by 600 pixels
so it appeared in the normal position that i wanted it to.
