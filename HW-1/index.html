  <h1>About Me </h1>

  <p>
    I am a media art major and i plan to have all of my classes finished by spring of next year. I grew up back and forth from Montana to North Carolina
    and graduated highschool in Polson, MT. I then returned to North Carolina to play college baseball for a couple years before returning to finish my
    courses at the University here in Missoula.

<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>
  One of my main hobbies is playing and watching other play video games. I just love everything about it, the experience, the art, the connection with friends, etc.
  For my career i really want to be a 3D artist or animator for video games or cartoons. Im not sure if i want to work for a big corporate company or a smaller and
  more down to earth indie game company. Either way that is the path i have chosen and i will do what i must to acheive that goal. I am also a part time streamer and
  youtube content creator. I dont get many views but it allows me to practice my video editing and helps me relieve some stress after a long day.
