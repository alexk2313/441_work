## Process
What i really wanted to do for this project was to create an audio visualization
using html5 canvas and the web audio api. I kept coming up with the same error and
started doing some research. Apparently most browsers have disabled the auto play feature
for audio due to ads auto playing in the browsers. This must have happened recently because
i cant find any fixes to get around this change.
## Decision
So after doing this research i decided to design a moveable art piece using the mouse. I found a really cool video
on youtube for using cos and sin to create circular movement in your objects. Once i had the movement set i just
had to map the x and y values to the mouse x and y. The cos and sin movement create a sense of 3d movement in a 2d
space and it is quite amazing. I decided to go with a tetrad color scheme (4 colors) and included a playable song
in the site itself.
